# Clode

Clode is a VST2 audio effect I developed. It creates some micro delays (in the frequency range, so as to create some notes) the exact delay length depends on the sound. It is a very aggressive effect and it produces some "clicks" but it can give some very interesting results, adding more notes to a sample.
